## Introduction

**Since the NIA server currently only provides game servers in China, the addons language are all Chinese at the moment. But you don't have to worry too much, a version with multi-language support is already in the making, so stay tuned!**

The bedrock version server based on BDS, open source of the addons R&D by NIA Group (including some codes using script-api) & almost our plugins running on LiteLoader.

We arenot professional extremely, some problems may be here like bug, none standard & logical confusion. We are glad to welcome everyone PR., and we will also carefully review, study & reply to each PR.

Though you may not use this addons right away on your local system without revising (due to the different game mechanics of each server) , but we hope that the addons & plugins may inspirate you, or be revised by yourself to adapt own server.

**Hope the project & server in the common development of the better & better. If the project does help you, CLICK A STAR PLZ!**

After completing the configuration, extract the behavior packs and resource packs to the `development_behavior_packs` and `development_resource_packs` folders respectively and you're ready to go!
